# Password-Locker
An app that lets the user store and create passwords for different accounts.

## Description
On Average, a person has at least 7 different accounts he or she has signed into, be it email, social media, entertainment or job portal accounts. It becomes really hard to remember all those passwords and even create new ones.

With the knowledge and skills we have now, I have created a python application that will help manage passwords and even generate new ones.

## Technologies Used
